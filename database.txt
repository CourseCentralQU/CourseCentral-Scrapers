How is data stored inside of rag_chunks:
- course_code is stored:
    - as 'general' if there is an associated prof, else skipped
    - as the course code, regardless of whether there is an associated prof or not
- professor_name is stored:
    - as NULL if there is no associated prof
    - as the prof name if there is an associated prof


reddit-scraper:
    - This will only get comments that:
        - have course_code, and no prof ('general_prof')
        - have course_code, and prof
        - have no course_code (stored as 'general_course'), and prof

rmp-scraper:
    - This will only get comments that: (by nature of design, there will ALWAYS be a prof name)
        - have course_code, and prof
        - have no course_code (stored as 'general_course'), and prof


By default, the database table courses will have an entry called 'general_course'
By default, the database table professors will have an entry called an entry called 'general_professor'
